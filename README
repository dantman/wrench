Wrench (aka: MonkeyScript Wrench)
=================================
Wrench.js is a JavaScript environment which bridges across server-side
and browser-side JavaScript,it serves as the base for MonkeyScript's stdlib.

The project provides Array and String prototypes which fill in the gap of
missing array and string manipulation methods in JavaScript,
as well as a few extra helpers.

Use
---
The file to use depends on where you intend to use Wrench.js and what version of
JavaScript the interpreter you are running supports.

For those using Wrench.js in the browser you want the 15 version which stands for
JavaScript 1.5, this version of JavaScript is the one spread over the web and
supported, it's based on ECMAScript version 3. You can include either wrench15.js
or for production systems you can include the minified version wrench15.min.js

For those using Rhino you are likely using the version that supports JavaScript 1.7
as at the time of writing Rhino's 1.8 support is not complete. What to use depends
on how you are using Rhino. If you are just using the default you should include
wrench15.js as the default does not have the important JavaScript 1.7 features
like `let` enabled. However if you are using the -version 170 argument or specifying
VERSION_1_7 to your JavaScript contexts you can instead include wrench17.js for
the added JavaScript 1.7 features.

For those using SpiderMonkey/TraceMonkey you have wider support. If you are using
a SpiderMonkey 1.7 release you follow the same guide as Rhino users if you are building
SpiderMonkey 1.8 yourself and using the flag to enable JavaScript 1.8 then you can
include wrench18.js to get the full range of supported features.

For those server-side using any other interpter, your engine likely only supports
JavaScript 1.5 and thus you should include wrench15.js.
